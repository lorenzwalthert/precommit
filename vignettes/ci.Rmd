# Setting up CI

When initializing pre-commit in your repo with
`precommit::use_precommit()`, you can specify the Continuous integration
provider with `ci = "native"` if you want to use
[pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci) or `ci = "gha"` if you want to
use GitHub Actions. For existing repos, use `precommit::use_ci()`.

Pre-commit will run the hooks on all files, so instead of pushing,
waiting and fixing issues locally, we recommend that you fix all
problems before pushing by invoking pre-commit (roughly) the same way as
it happens in the CI, which is described in the next section.

# Emulate a CI run locally

In the CI run, a command roughly equivalent to the following will be ran
from the command line:

``` bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

If you get an error and `pre-commit` is not on your `$PATH` (e.g.
because you installed with `precommit::install_precommit()`), you can
locate the executable from R with

``` r
precommit::path_pre_commit_exec()
#> "/usr/local/bin/pre-commit" 
```

And run the command in your bash terminal like this:

``` bash
/usr/local/bin/pre-commit run --all-files
```

Then fix the problems, stage the files and re-try until the command
succeeds without more errors.

# Comparison

Next, we quickly introduce the two options. We recommend
[pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci), but you might have to skip the
roxygenize hook in the ci run under certain circumstances as explained
below.

## pre-commit.ci

**Pros:**

-   by the creator of pre-commit. Certain CI settings in
    `.pre-commit-config.yaml` [are supported](https://pre-commit.ci).
-   actively developed.
-   very fast.
-   will at some point also be supported for repos hosted outside of
    GitHub.
-   No maintenance effort for you.
-   No additional file in the repo.

**Cons:**

-   You need to authenticate the [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci)
    App in GitHub.

-   Limitations for the roxygenize hook:

    -   {roxygen2} [requires loading your package for the roxygenize
        hook](https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2/issues/771), which means
        you must list all dependencies of the package explicitly in
        `.pre-commit-config.yaml` under `id: roxygenize`. You can
        generate the required code with
        `precommit::snippet_generate('additional-deps-roxygenize')`.
        This is also required to run the hook locally.
    -   There is a [timeout of 120s for building a hook
        environment](https://github.com/pre-commit-ci/runner-image/issues/93#issuecomment-922505301),
        which might not be enough time to build the hook environment for
        the roxygenize hook (if you package has many dependencies). This
        holds for local and remote execution.
    -   \`System dependencies are not supported. In particular, since
        {roxygen2} [requires loading your package for the roxygenize
        hook](https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2/issues/771), this hook
        will fail if your package has system dependencies or any of your
        package's dependencies has system dependencies that are not
        shipped with the package.

-   To overcome the above limitations, you can:

    -   Disable the hook completely (by commenting out the respective
        lines in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`).
    -   Use GitHub Actions as a CI provider instead with
        `precommit::use_ci("gha")`.
    -   Skip it on CI as described below

    ``` yaml
    ci:
        skip: [roxygenize]
    ```

**Customization:**

Please see the documentation of [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci/)
on whether or not to auto-fix problems as well as other configuration
options.

## GitHub Actions

**Pros:**

-   more control over environment, e.g. system dependencies.
-   No new authentication needed.
-   If your package has system dependencies and you want to use the
    roxygenize hook, you can install them.

**Cons:**

-   No configuration options such as hook skipping supported that
    [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci) supports.
-   You need to maintain the workflow file with a lot of boilerplate
    code and when GitHub changes the syntax, you need to adapt it to
    prevent failing builds.
-   You'll have one additional file per provider (e.g. GitHub, Gitlab).
